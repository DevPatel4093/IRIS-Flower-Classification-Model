# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification 

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Iris Flower Classification** project is a machine learning classification task that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its **sepal and petal measurements**. The dataset contains three species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to accurately classify Iris flowers.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can:
- Learn from labeled Iris flower data
- Classify flowers into their respective species
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

This dataset is widely used for **introductory classification tasks** in machine learning.

## Dataset 📑📊

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris <br>

🔺Iris setosa<br>
🔺Iris virginica<br>
🔺Iris versicolor <br>
Four features were measured from each sample (in centimetres):<br>

🔘Length of the sepals<br>
🔘Width of the sepals<br>
🔘Length of the petals<br>
🔘Width of the petals<br>

## Model Training and Evaluation
### 1.Data Loading:

Load the dataset using pandas.
### 2.Data Exploration:

Display descriptive statistics and the first few rows of the dataset.
### 3.Data Preparation:

Split the dataset into features (X) and target (Y).<br>
Split the data into training and test sets using train_test_split.
### 4.Model Training:

Train a Logistic Regression model using the training data.
### 5.Model Evaluation:

Make predictions on the test data.<br>
Evaluate the model using accuracy score and classification report.
